# Fair-Allocation
Worked on Fair Allocation Problems with Doctoral Student Justin Payan using Neural Networks.
Used Deep Learning tool PyTorch to train a neural network to search over probabilistic allocations and arrive at a
deterministic allocation.
Used the Neural Network to maximize ”welfare” and minimize ”envy”.
Performed experiments with the mallows model with 50 agents and 100 goods which showed a linear increase in welfare
with decreasing entropy of the probabilistic distributions, Entropy ranged from 0.15 - 0.95.
